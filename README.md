# Fourier methods and frequency analysis for fun

---

***FFT.***

Fast Fourier transform.

Notes:

As electrical engineering undergrads, we had to learn a lot of scary things, and these three letters, FFT, induced a lot of anxiety.

As usual though, there's an easier way to learn about things than the proof-heavy approach professors wield as tools of torture.

This talk is going to be a little about Fourier analysis itself but a lot about three of my favorite applications:

---

- Audio frequencies: what's a signal ü§î
- Image processing: cutting signals üßë‚Äçüî¨
- Terrain visualization: massage signals üíÜ

Notes:

These are by no means all the things that Fourier techniques are used for. Every field that uses a sensor probably has some niche full of experts in Fourier theory:

- the brain scientists who work with EEG,
- the geoscientists searching for oil,
- the astronomers peering at exoplanets,

not to mention countless applications in pure mathematics and physics. Any theory as old and mathematically deep as this is bound to show up in all sorts of places.
